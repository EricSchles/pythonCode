Each room will have its own class.  Classes may interoperate.  

Game description:

This will be a Zelda game.  Link finds himself in a dungeon.  He knows he has to get out of the dungeon.  Also he cannot remember how he got there in the first place.  As Link moves through each room, he realizes how he got there.  It turns out, Link is actually unconscious and in a battle.  Zelda was take by a killer.  You tracked the killer to the dungeon.  The final scene is you waking up, and fighting the killer.
